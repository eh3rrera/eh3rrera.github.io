I wrote another tutorial for the [hack.guides() contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/). This time it's about integrating [Horizon.io](http://horizon.io/) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) using OAuth for authentication.

You can read it [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/interesting-apis/building-a-real-time-application-with-react-react-router-horizon-io-and-oauth) and the source code of the app is available on [Github](https://github.com/eh3rrera/react-horizon).

If you like it please give it a heart or a share and if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.
