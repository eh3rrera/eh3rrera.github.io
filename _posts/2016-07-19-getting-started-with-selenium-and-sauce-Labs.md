I wrote another tutorial for the [hack.guides() contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/). This time it's about creating tests with [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com) in Java.

You can read it [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/software-engineering-best-practices/getting-started-with-selenium-and-sauce-labs) and the source code of the app is available on [Github](https://github.com/eh3rrera/selenium-saucelabs-example).

If you like it please give it a heart or a share and if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.
