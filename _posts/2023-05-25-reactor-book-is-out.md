Well, it's better late than never.

Over the past year, I've been diligently working in my free time to create a course about Project Reactor.

Ultimately, I decided to write a book first. You can read it for free here: 
[https://eherrera.net/project-reactor-course/](https://eherrera.net/project-reactor-course/)

The associated GitHub repository, which contains all the code examples and exercises from the book, as well as the book's content, can be found here:
[https://github.com/eh3rrera/project-reactor-course](https://github.com/eh3rrera/project-reactor-course)

To be honest, I'm uncertain about when I'll have the time to work on a video course. I have other tasks I'd like to prioritize at the moment, such as converting some of my video courses into books.

However, if you'd like to support my work, you can purchase the Reactor book on:
- [Leanpub as EPUB and PDF](https://leanpub.com/unraveling-project-reactor)
- [Amazon as e-book and paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3PWZH1Q)

As I self-publish my books, it's quite easy to overlook details, make formatting errors or include typos. Therefore, any contributions or feedback are greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
