I [promised](http://eherrera.net/ocpj-8-beta-experience/) I'll write a book about the OCPJ8 exam. The most easy way would be to reformat my [OCPJ8 notes](http://eherrera.net/ocpj8-notes/), change or add some examples, maybe rewrite some parts, and launch it.

But in the end, I chose to start from scratch. I chose to do a complete rewrite to review all the topics and find the way to explain and present them in a better way.

So I started more than one month ago, but as always, I have met an old enemy, procrastination. I have more projects in mind, but I don't think is right to start them without first finishing this one.

That being said, this is the table of content which is guiding the work right now and the percentage of completion of each chapter:

As you can see, I only have ONE chapter finished. Of thirty. One.

At least, I have almost finished other five chapters.

My goal is to finish this book in two months, I mean, to have it published (at least the e-book version) before September 31th 2015.

My next step is finishing those almost-done five chapters and release a beta version on [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com), so watch for the next update in about a week.
