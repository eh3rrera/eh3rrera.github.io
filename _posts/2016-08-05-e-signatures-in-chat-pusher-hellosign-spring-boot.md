I wrote another tutorial for the [hack.guides() contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/). This time it's about requesting e-signatures in a chat with Pusher and HelloSign, using a Java stack with Spring Boot.

You can read it [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/interesting-apis/requesting-e-signatures-in-a-chat-with-pusher-hellosign-and-spring-boot) and the source code of the app is available on [Github](https://github.com/eh3rrera/nda-chat).

If you like it please give it a heart or a share, and if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.
