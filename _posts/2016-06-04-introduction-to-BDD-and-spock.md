Two weeks ago, I wrote an article in [hack.guides()](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/) about testing with the [Spock Framework](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) and using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

Yesterday, the article was published in the main page (it was in review). You can find it [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/java-and-j2ee/introduction-to-testing-with-bdd-and-the-spock-framework).

I think the Spock framework (and BDD) is the best option to create unit tests and you should at least, check it out.

As always, if I can help you in any way, don't hesitate to contact me.
