I wrote another tutorial for the [hack.guides() contest](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/). This time it's about visualizing tweets in real-time using [PubNub's Stream Controller](https://www.pubnub.com/products/stream-controller/), CSS3 animations, and a Node.js stack.

You can read it [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/interesting-apis/visualizing-tweets-with-pubnub-s-stream-controller-and-css3-animations) and the source code of the app is available on [Github](https://github.com/eh3rrera/visual-tweets).
