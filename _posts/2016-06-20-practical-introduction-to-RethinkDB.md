There's a tutorial writing contest in [hack.guides()](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/contest/). Basically, you have to write a tutorial using one (or more) of the following APIs:
- [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit)
- [Fanout](https://fanout.io/)
- [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/api)
- [Horizon Cloud](http://horizon.io/)
- [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/)
- [Keen.io](http://keen.io/)
- Pluralsight (you have to write about a software development practice)
- [PubNub](http://pubnub.com/)
- [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/)
- [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com/)
- [Uber](https://developer.uber.com/)

So I chose RethinkDB as the topic of my first article.

You can read it [here](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com/nosql-databases/a-practical-introduction-to-rethinkdb).

First, I explain the basics of RethinkDB and at then end, there a simple application as an example of how to develop a real-time application using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [RethinkDB's changefeeds](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/javascript/) and [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/).

[This](https://github.com/eh3rrera/rethinkdb-example) is the Github repository for the application and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
