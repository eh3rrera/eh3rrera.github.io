The site javapracticequestions.com is temporarily down while I work on making it better.

Until now, it had been just a promotional site for my java 7 certification books, but now that java 8 is out, I'll work to make it more than that.

The problem is that I have a lot of things to do this year, so it may be up again until early 2016.

In the meantime, you can contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/eh3rrera" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:&#101;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#98;&#97;&#110;&#104;&#98;&#50;&#64;&#121;&#97;&#104;&#111;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#46;&#109;&#120;">email</a>.
