<p>I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla,_Puebla">Puebla, Mexico</a>. I've been developing software for over ten years, mostly in Java. Here are a few things about me:</p>

<p><b>The first programming language I learned was Visual Basic 5.0.</b> We're talking about 1997. Next was C. Then Java. Then PHP. Then C#. And then Objective-C.</p>

<p><b>I have two wonderful kids.</b> Santiago, born in 2010, and Diego, born in 2014.</p>

<p><b>I'm old school.</b> I prefer to talk to people in person. I'm not really into social media. I'm only kind of active in Twitter and Github. I have <a href="https://www.quora.com/Esteban-Herrera" target="_blank">Quora</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7454930.Esteban_Herrera" target="_blank">Goodread</a> accounts but I don't use them very much. </p>

<p><b>I have more than six IT certifications</b>. The most difficult was PMI's PMP.</p>

<p><b>I don't like to drive</b>. I hate being stuck in traffic. I prefer to walk or public transportation (like subway).</p>

<p><b>I have a lot of favorites movies</b>. Two that come to my mind right now are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884" target="_blank">Contact</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105323" target="_blank">Scent of a Woman</a>.</p>

<p>More to come...</p>
