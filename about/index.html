<p>I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla,_Puebla">Puebla, Mexico</a>. I've been developing software for over ten years, mostly in Java. Here are 15 things about me I like to share with you:</p>

<p><b>The first programming language I learned was Visual Basic 5.0.</b> We're talkig about 1997, I can't remember very well.</p>

<p><b>I have two wonderful kids.</b> Santiago, born in 2010, and Diego, born in 2014.</p>

<p><b>I'm old school.</b> I prefer to talk to people in person. I don't have a Facebook account. I only open a Twitter and Github in March, 2015. </p>

<p><b>I have more than six IT certifications</b>. The most difficult was PMI's PMP.</p>
